I'm a recent sociology grad from Colorado College and a self-taught designer. I chose design because I want to make other people’s lives better at scale. My sociological eye helps me maximize my positive social impact. 

Previously, I built an ecommerce site to sell fresh produce from local farms to my neighbors. I also helped a startup grow from 4 friends to a $10 million evaluation. 

When I’m not working, I cook, play Factorio and Overwatch, and read.
