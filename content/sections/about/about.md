I'm a recent sociology graduate from Colorado College and a self-taught designer. My sociological background guides my work towards **positive social impact.**

Previously, I setup an [ecommerce site](https://phxfood.coop/pages/about-the-co-op) to sell fresh produce from local farms to underserved communities in my hometown. I also helped a [startup](https://contenda.co) grow from 4 friends to a $10 million evaluation. 

When Iâ€™m not working, I cook, play Factorio and Overwatch, and read.
