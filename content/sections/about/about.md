I'm a recent sociology graduate from Colorado College and a self-taught designer. My sociological background guides me towards anything with a **positive social impact.**

Previously, I set up an [ecommerce site](https://phxfood.coop) to sell fresh produce from local farms to underserved communities in my hometown. I also helped a [startup](https://contenda.co) grow from 4 friends to a $10 million evaluation. 

When Iâ€™m not working, I cook for my friends, bike, desperately try to get better at Rocket League, and read sci-fi.
